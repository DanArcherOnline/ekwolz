# Ekwolz

A calcualtor in a different style.
I took the functionality I like from Android’s and IOS’s built in calculators to make a calculator work how I would like it to work.

## Features
### Current Features
The functionality I chose to use in Ekwolz are as follows:
-	Pressing equals does not delete input (like it does in IOS)
-	A clear/all clear button for quick erasure (like IOS)
-	Highlight operator buttons when selected (like IOS)
-	Format numbers with commas to make reading large numbers easier
-	Text automatically resizes as numbers get larger
-	Button states and data persist on device rotation
-	Full screen BG that adapts according to orientation and device type
-	Equals button repeats the last equation on the result (like IOS)

### Planned Features
-	Viewing equation history (similar to Android)
-	The decimal button
-	A backspace button (similar to Android)
-	Data persistence when the application is closed and reopened
-	Button animations

### Bugs/Improvements
-	Displaying infinity better
-	Make sure NaN is never displayed



## installation

Clone this repository and import into **Android Studio**

`git clone https://github.com/DanArcherOnline/ekwolz.git

## Background Story
I was asked to make a calculator app for a job interview ability check.
I don’t like copying everyone else so I decided to design a new layout for the calculator buttons instead of using the classical grid layout.

I played around with IOS’s and Android’s calculators and chose to implement the functionality I liked from each of them, as well as changing the functionality to suit my preferences.


## Screenshots

Screenshots will be added very soon.
